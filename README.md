## Background

We’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Our firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, our firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave our firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. We’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, we’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

## What's Being Created

We’ll combine our new algorithmic trading skills with our existing skills in financial Python programming and machine learning to create an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets.

In a Jupyter notebook, we’ll do the following:

 - Implement an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions.

 - Adjust the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm.

 - Train a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model. 
 
We will also create a report that compares the performance of the machine learning models based on the trading predictions that each makes and the resulting cumulative strategy returns.

## Technologies

This application is written in Python 3.7 using JupyterLab version 3.0.14.

Python libraries used:

 - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - *an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.*
 - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - *the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python*
 - [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pathlib.html) - *a library that enables consistent input and output of files from the main app.*
 - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - *a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.*
 - [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - *a high-level plotting API built on HoloViews that provides a general and consistent API for plotting data*
 - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - *an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning.*


### Installation Guide

prior to running these libraries, install them from the command line:
  - pandas: `conda install pandas` or `pip install pandas`  
  - numpy: `conda install numpy` or `pip install numpy`
  - pathlib: `pip install pathlib`
  - matplotlib: `conda install matplotlib` or `pip install matplotlib`
  - sklearn: `pip install-U scikit-learn` - included in conda

## Usage

As part of your GitHub repository’s README.md file, you will also create a report that compares the performance of the machine learning models based on the trading predictions that each makes and the resulting cumulative strategy returns.
